Goals of  performance  testing:

1. Production readiness from  performance point of view
	- application response time with expected load.
	- system behaviour with unexpected loads
	- system behaviour with spike loads
	- System scalability
	- best system configuration for optimal performance
2. Comparing your system performance on multiple platforms.
3. Comparing performance of system configuration
4. Evaluating your system against performance criterias
5. Determining the thruput and response time
6. Discover what parts of the application perform poorly and under what conditions
7. Analysing and finding the source of the performance problems
8. Support system tuning.


Pre-requistic for performance testing

1. Perf env - a dedicated, defect-free and stable performance environment.
2. Perf env should be as close to production env.
3. Gather performance testing requirements:
	- Application architecture
	- Application development methodologies
	- Server informations, configurations, db size
	- Application usage information
	- Application usage patterns.
	- Perf acceptance criteria
4. Performance test plan
5. Performance test data
6. Performance tool requried to perform the test
7. Training on the performance tools and processes


Performance Testing Activites

1. Identify Test Environment
2. Identify Performance Acceptance Criteria
3. Plan and Design Test
4. Configure Test Environment
5. Implement Test Design
6. Execute Tests
7. Analyze Reports and Re-test

Symptons of web application performance problems

* Long response time
* Memory leaks
* High CPU usage

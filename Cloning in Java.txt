Clone():
------------

* clone() is a method in the Object class.  
* the process of creating exactly duplicate objects is called cloning. 
* main objective of cloning is maintian backup.
* sytax of clone method in Object class is    -  protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException

Imp points:
-----------
1. We can call the clone() method only for clonable objects.
2. An object is said to be cloneable only if the corresponding class implements the cloneable interface.
3. clonable interface is avaiable in the java.lang package. It is a marker interface and does not contain any methods.


Deep cloning vs Shallow Cloning:
--------------------------------
Shallow cloning:  The process of creating just duplicate reference variable but not duplicate object is called shallow cloning.
Deep cloning: The process of creating exactly duplicate independent object is called deep cloning.

Eg:

Test t = new Test();
Test t1 = new Test();
Test t2 = t1;          			 # shallow cloning
Test t3 = (Test)t1.clone();		 # deep cloning.  as clone() returns on Object, you need to typcast it to the respective class.

By default, cloning means deep cloning.

super() vs this():
-----------------

1. The first line inside a constructor should be either super() or this().
2. If we dont specify anything, compiler will always  call super().

Rules:
------------
1. The first line inside a constructor should be either super() or this().  If you keep them in second or any other line, CE:
2. We cannot specify both super() and this() in the same constructor. It will throw CE:.  We can specify only one of them in the first line.
3. super() or this() can only be used inside a constructor.  We cannot use them in normal methods. If  we do we will get CE:.
4. this() - to call current class constructors.
5. super() - to call  parent class constructors.
6. compiler provides default as super(), but not this().

There are super() and this() methods.  Also there are "super" and "this" keywords in java.

		super() and this()											super and this
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. these are constructor calls			1. these are keywords used to reference super and current class instance members.
2. can be used only in constructors		2. these keywords can be used anywhere except static members and static blocks.

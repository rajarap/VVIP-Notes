Instance in Java:
-----------------
Process:  When ever we create an object the following sequence of events will be performed automatically:

1. identification of all instance members of the class from top to bottom.
2. Execution of all instance variable assignments and instance blocks from top to bottom.
3. Execution of constructor method.

Note:  Static control flow is only a one time activity which is performed at the time of class loading.   But instance control flow is not a one time activity.
Based on the number of objects created, the instance flow control will be executed that many times for each object.


When we create child class objects, the following process will be performed automatically:

1. Identification of instance members from parent to child.
2. Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks only in parent class.
3. Execution of parent class constructor.
4. Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks of child class.
5. Execution of child class constructor.

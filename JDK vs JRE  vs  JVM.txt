JDK vs JRE  vs  JVM:
-----------------------

* JDK: To develop and run java application the required environment is provided by JDK.
* JRE: To run java application the required environment is  provided by JRE.
* JVM: Responsible to execute the java program.

* JDK = JRE+tools
* JRE = JVM+libraries.

* JDK is installed on machines where we have to develop and run java based application.
* JRE is installed on client machines where you only require a run time environment to execute the java application.  since no development happens here,
  JDK is not required on this machine.
  
  
  
Path vs Classpath:
-------------------
Path:
------
set the 'Path' variable to specify the location where the binary executables are available. If 'path' variable is not set, then java and javac commands
wont work.

Classpath:
----------
set the 'Classpath' variable to specify the location where the required .class files are avialable. If 'Classpath' variable is not set, then  our programs
wont run.

gc can be scheduled. If threshold is reached, gc can be initiated
heap  - memory available for storing objects
gc should not cause long pauses to the application when gc is operational - concurrent vs stop the world
fragmentation - compaction
scalability

GC design:
serial  vs parrallel gc
concurrent vs stop the world gc
compacting vs non-compacting vs copying

GC Performance metrics:

GC Throughput - time spent in not performing GC.
GC overhead - time spent in performing GC
Pause time - length of time the app stops/pauses during GC
Frequency of GC - how many times GC occurs is relative to the executing  of the application
Footprint - related to size like heap size
Promptness - time when obj becomes garbage and when GC collects the dead obj and memory becomes available.

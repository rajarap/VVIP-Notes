Coupling vs Cohesion: part1 - 248
-------------------------

Coupling: 
--------------
The degree of dependency between components is called coupling. 
Eg: class A is dependent on class B, class B is dependent on class C etc

Note: Coupling is not recommended because it has various disadvantages:

1. Without affecting the other dependents its diffcult to modify code in one component. Hence enhancement will become diffcult.
2. It does not promote re-usability.

Hence it is highly recommended to maintain loosely coupled classes. Dependency between components shoud be as less as possible.




Cohesion:
----------
Every component must contain a clear and well-defined functionality. Such component is said to follow high-cohesion.

Eg: 
1. If you define all the functionalities like login, registration, payments etc in one class, then that class is said to follow low-cohesion.
2. If each functionalities are defined in seperate well defined classes then these classes are said to follow high-cohesion.

High cohesion is always good for programming as it has various adv:

1. Without affecting other components we can modify any component. Hence enhancement becomes very easy.
2. It improves maintainability of the application.
3. It promotes re-usability of the code.

Hence,  LOOSE Coupling and HIGH cohesion is a good programming practice.

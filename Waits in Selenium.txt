here there are two keywords: Present and visible.
Web elements present on the page
Web elements visible on the page

Implicit wait:

- implicit wait is a default timeout for all the driver.findElements commands.
- waits till the time the element is present on the page.  Wether the element is visible or not visible, it is not concerned about that.


Explicit wait:

- Explicit wait waits for a particular web element to be visible on the page, not just be present on the page.
- explicit wait is implemented in Selenium using the WebDriverWait class.  This class is a child class of Fluent Wait.

Type Casting: (part 1 - 242)
-------------

1. Parent class reference variable can be used to hold child class object.  Eg: Parent p = new Child();
2. Interface reference variable can be used to hold implementing class object.  Eg: Runnable r = new Thread();

			A b = (C) d;

A - can be a class or interface
b - reference variable
(C) - can be a class or interface.
d - object reference or object.

Compiler checking rules:
-----------------------------
1. (C) and type of 'd' must have some relationship (either parent to child or child to parent or same type). Else CE: Inconvertible types found d type required C type.
2. (C) must be same or derived type of 'A', else CE:Incompatible types.

Runtime(JVM) checking rules:
---------------------------
1. The underlying object of 'd' must be either same or derived type of (C). else RE: ClassCase Exception.
